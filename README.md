What Is This Project About?
---------------------------

This repository hosts the kernel source tree of the [Nanvix Operating
System](https://github.com/nanvix). This kernel features a minimalist
(ie. microkernel) design, by providing only those abstractions that
are required in order to enable a rich system to be implemented on its
top.
